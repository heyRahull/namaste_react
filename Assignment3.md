### 1. What is `NPM`?

NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage packages or libraries of JavaScript code to build applications. With NPM, developers can easily manage project dependencies, run scripts, and publish their own packages to the NPM registry.

### 2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

Parcel and Webpack are both module bundlers for JavaScript applications. They are used to bundle various assets, such as JavaScript files, CSS files, and images, into a single output file or files. This bundling process optimizes the performance of web applications by reducing the number of HTTP requests and optimizing the size of the files transferred to the client's browser.

### 3. What is `.parcel-cache`?

The .parcel-cache directory is created by Parcel, a zero-configuration web application bundler. It stores cached data and intermediate build artifacts to speed up the build process for subsequent builds. It helps in improving build performance by avoiding unnecessary recompilation of unchanged assets.

### 4. What is `npx` ?

npx is a command-line utility that comes with npm 5.2.0 and higher. It allows executing Node.js packages directly without installing them globally. npx executes packages from the local node_modules or downloads and installs them temporarily, enabling developers to run commands from packages without polluting the global package space.

### 5. What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?

Dependencies listed in the dependencies section of package.json are required for the application to run in production, while those in the devDependencies section are only needed during development. Production dependencies are installed when the application is deployed, whereas development dependencies are used for tasks like testing, linting, or building the application.

### 6. What is Tree Shaking?

Tree shaking is a technique used in JavaScript bundlers like Webpack and Parcel to remove dead or unused code from the final bundle. It analyzes the module dependencies in the application and eliminates any code that is not being imported or used, resulting in a smaller bundle size and improved performance.

### 7. What is Hot Module Replacement?

Hot Module Replacement is a feature in module bundlers like Webpack and Parcel that allows developers to replace modules in a running application without a full page reload. It updates the changed modules in the browser's runtime environment, preserving the application's state and providing a faster development experience.

### 8. List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.

- Zero configuration setup: Parcel requires no configuration, making it easy to start a project without spending time on setup.
- Fast bundling speed: Parcel's blazing fast bundling speed reduces development time by quickly compiling and bundling assets.
- Automatic asset optimization: Parcel automatically optimizes assets like images and CSS, reducing file sizes for better performance.
- Built-in hot module replacement: Parcel comes with built-in support for hot module replacement, enabling instant updates to the application during development.
- Code splitting: Parcel automatically analyzes the project's dependency graph and generates optimized bundles with code splitting for better load times.

### 9. What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?

.gitignore is a file used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It helps prevent unnecessary files from being included in the version control system. Common entries include build artifacts, dependencies, and environment-specific files. Developers should add files like node_modules, build output directories, and sensitive configuration files to .gitignore while keeping essential files like package.json and source code under version control.

### 10. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

- package.json: This file contains metadata about a Node.js project, including project name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It is used to define project settings and dependencies but does not lock the exact versions of dependencies.
- package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated by npm to lock the exact versions of dependencies installed in a project. It ensures that subsequent installations of dependencies use the same versions to maintain consistency across environments.

### 11. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

package-lock.json manually is discouraged because it can lead to inconsistencies in dependency versions across different environments. npm automatically manages this file to ensure that dependencies are installed with the same versions across installations. Modifying it manually can result in conflicts and unexpected behavior during dependency resolution.

### 12. What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?

node_modules: node_modules is a directory where npm installs project dependencies. It contains all the packages specified in the dependencies and devDependencies sections of package.json. It is not recommended to push node_modules to version control systems like Git due to its large size and the availability of package.json to specify dependencies.

### 13. What is the `dist` folder?

The dist (distribution) folder is typically used to store the production-ready version of a web application. It contains optimized and bundled assets, such as JavaScript files, CSS files, and images, ready for deployment. Developers often generate the dist folder as part of the build process using tools like Webpack or Parcel.

### 14. What is `browserlists`?

Browserlist is a configuration file used by tools like Babel and Autoprefixer to specify the list of target browsers for which a project's JavaScript or CSS should be compiled or transformed. It helps ensure compatibility with specific browser versions by generating appropriate vendor prefixes and polyfills based on the specified browser targets.

### 15. Differences between bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Parcel)

- Vite: Vite is a modern build tool that focuses on fast development and optimized production builds. It leverages ES modules for faster loading during development and offers hot module replacement out of the box. Vite uses Rollup for production builds and offers first-class support for Vue.js projects.
- Webpack: Webpack is a widely-used module bundler that offers extensive configuration options and a powerful plugin system. It supports code splitting, asset optimization, and hot module replacement, making it suitable for a wide range of projects.

* Parcel: Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler that aims to simplify the build process. It offers fast bundling speeds, automatic asset optimization, and support for various file types out of the box. Parcel is well-suited for small to medium-sized projects where simplicity and speed are priorities.

### 16. Caret (^) and Tilde (~) in versioning:

- Caret (^): The caret symbol before a version number in package.json allows npm to install compatible updates for the specified dependency. It updates to the latest minor or patch version while keeping the major version fixed. For example, "^1.2.3" would allow installing versions 1.2.3 to 1.9.9, but not 2.0.0.
- Tilde (~): The tilde symbol before a version number in package.json allows npm to install compatible updates for the specified dependency within the same minor version range. It updates to the latest patch version while keeping the major and minor versions fixed. For example, "~1.2.3" would allow installing versions 1.2.3 to 1.2.9, but not 1.3.0.

### 17. Script types in HTML

- text/javascript: This is the default type for JavaScript code.
- module: This type is used for JavaScript modules, allowing for the use of ES6 module syntax.
- text/ecmascript: This type is used for ECMAScript code. However, it's not commonly used due to compatibility concerns.
